title: Lightning UI Kit
label: Overview
---

A production-ready component library for Rails applications. Build polished interfaces without writing repetitive UI code.

## Why?

### Ship Faster
Pre-built components for forms, modals, dropdowns, tables, and more. Stop rebuilding the same UI patterns from scratch.

### Rails Native
Deep integration with Rails form builders, validations, and Active Record associations. Components work seamlessly with your existing Rails code.

### Zero Conflicts
All Tailwind classes are prefixed with `lui:` so they never clash with your application's styles. Use alongside your existing CSS without worry.

**Association Handling** - Combobox supports `has_many` and `belongs_to` relationships, nested attributes, and tracks removed associations.

**Remote Data** - Combobox supports server-side filtering with built-in debouncing for performance.

**Error Integration** - Components automatically display validation errors from Rails form objects and associations.
